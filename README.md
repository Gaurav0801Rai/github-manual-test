# GitHub Manual Test 

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This little repo is just me playing around with GitHub and figuring out how to push files (in this case, an Excel sheet) to a repository.  

## What's inside?  
- A single Excel file: `data/Github manual Test.xlsx`  
- Thatâ€™s it â€” nothing fancy, just something to test and learn.  

## Why did I make this?  
I wanted a simple place to:  
- Practice using GitHub.  
- Get comfortable with pushing non-code files like Excel.  
- See how GitHub handles version control when the file isnâ€™t a `.js` or `.py` file.  

## How you can use it ðŸ›   
If youâ€™re also new to GitHub, you can:  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-manual-test.git
